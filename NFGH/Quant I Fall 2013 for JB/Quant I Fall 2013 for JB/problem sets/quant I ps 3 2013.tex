must be your own. \ Handwritten work is acceptable, but word-processed work
(e.g., using LaTeX) is preferred.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that%
\begin{equation*}
VAR(Y)\equiv \int_{-\infty }^{\infty }(y-\mu )^{2}f(y)dy=E(Y^{2})-\mu ^{2}.
\end{equation*}%
\medskip 

\item Show that%
\begin{align*}
P(a& <Y_{1}\leq b,c<Y_{2}\leq
d)=\int_{c}^{d}\int_{a}^{b}f(y_{1},y_{2})dy_{1}dy_{2} \\
& =F(b,d)-F(b,c)-F(a,d)+F(a,c).
\end{align*}%
